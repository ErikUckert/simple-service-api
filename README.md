# simple-service-api

This is a a simple restful api demo build to play around with docker compose functionality.

It's following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw9zlE3t8Ko) tutorial from [Jake Wright](https://github.com/jakewright).

## How to get it running

- Clone this repository
- Install docker ([for learning how to do that check out the official sources](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/))
- Change directory to the cloned repository directory
- Run in your comand line
    ```
    docker-compose up
    ```

## Notes
This example uses php, which is not my kind of language. I copied the code from Jake, without questioning it. Maybe I will build a pure python or javascript example later on.
